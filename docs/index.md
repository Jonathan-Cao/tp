Are your clothes all over the place, and you can never seem to remember what clothes you do have? Well fret not, with NuFash, organising your clothes becomes a breeze!

With our easy to use GUI, all you have to do is to enter in your clothes once into NuFash, and you will be able to look up your clothes as and when you need it!

**NuFash is a desktop application for managing your clothes.** 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using NuFash, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NuFash, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
